## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I'm trying to learn more about flexbox and how to use its attributes to properly display the elements on different screens sizes.

### Continued development

Since I'm just starting my learning of HTML, CSS and web development in general, I'm still focusing on learning every aspect of these technologies, especially the fundamentals.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This source is helping me a lot in understanding the aspects of each element and attribute of HTML5 and CSS3.
